<h1>Shaded relief</h1>


<h2>Common shaded relief</h2>

Creation of shaded relief map has two steps. First, compute the shaded relief:
<code><pre>
r.relief input=elevation output=elevation_shade
</pre></code>

You can use the created raster right-away if you want gray shaded relief.
If you want to combine it with color, you can also add both rasters to
the Layer Manager and set opacity of the shaded relief. However, for the best
result use <em>d.shade</em> module to combine both rasters.
Use Add shaded map item
in the toolbar (under Add other raster layers) or use the following:

<code><pre>
d.shade shade=elevation_shade color=elevation
</pre></code>

This has the advantage of not creating additional raster while enabling to
use the shaded relief in diffident ways. Alternatively, it is possible to
create the shaded raster map with color as a separate raster using
<em>r.shade</em> module which does the same
as <em>d.shade</em> but instead of rendering the image it creates
a raster map.

<p>
We have used shaded relief raster for shading and elevation raster for the color,
however any combination of rasters can be used to achieve different results.


<h2>Sky-view factor</h2>

Install <em>r.skyview</em> module from Addons using <em>g.extension</em>:

<code><pre>
g.extension r.skyview
</pre></code>

Now you can compute the sky-view factor:

<code><pre>
r.skyview input=elevation output=elevation_skyview ndir=8
</pre></code>

A higher number of directions makes the computation longer but
it gives a finer result.

<p>
As suggested above, sky-view factor can be combined with other rasters
using <em>r.shade</em> module.
